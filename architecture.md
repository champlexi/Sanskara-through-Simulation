🌱 1. Modular Story Architecture

Treat each story as a self-contained module.

Example: Krishna & Kaliya is one module.

Later, Hanuman crossing the ocean is another.

Each module should include:

Environment (riverbank, forest, palace)

Characters (3–5 main characters per story)

Core interactions (walking, observing, asking questions)

AI Q&A knowledge base (limited to the story at first)

Keep metadata for each story: theme, dharmic lesson, age appropriateness, difficulty. This helps for later curation and connecting concepts across stories.

🧩 2. Layered Learning Design

Layer 1 (Experience): He sees the story happening.

Layer 2 (Reflection): He asks questions, hears explanations, sees consequences.

Layer 3 (Connection): Later, you can link stories conceptually. Example: “What Krishna did with Kaliya is similar to what Rama did with Ravana — both restore balance.”

By separating experience, reflection, and connection, you can add new philosophical layers without redesigning old stories.

🤖 3. AI & Knowledge Extensibility

Start with story-specific AI knowledge.

Later, build a central knowledge layer:

This layer understands concepts (dharma, karma, ahimsa, courage, devotion)

Any story module can query it.

This way, the AI can eventually answer questions like:

“How does Krishna’s courage relate to Arjuna’s dharma?”

“What does the Upanishad say about overcoming fear?”

Designing this layer early ensures you can extend from single stories to full-scale Puranic + Upanishadic knowledge.

🛠️ 4. Technical Extensibility Tips

Use a data-driven design:

Store story content (dialogues, narration, interactions) in JSON or scriptable objects.

VR scenes just read the data — no hardcoding.

Keep characters and environments reusable:

Krishna in one story can appear in another without rebuilding.

Separate AI logic from visuals:

AI answers should be decoupled from 3D animations.

Version your modules:

Allows updates, improvements, or corrections as you learn more from texts.

🌟 5. Philosophical / Learning Extensibility

Tag every module with themes and values. Example:

Courage, devotion, patience, balance, justice, compassion.

Later, you can create paths or learning journeys:

e.g., a “Courage Path” where he experiences multiple stories highlighting courage.

This allows your son to see patterns and connections across stories, even as he grows older.

💡 Summary:
Even if your first step is just one story, you can design it so:

Adding new stories is easy.

The AI can gradually expand to handle deeper questions.

Conceptual links between stories and philosophical teachings can be built over time.

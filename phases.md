Here’s a roadmap you could consider to keep things manageable and cost-effective:

🌱 Phase 1: Start Simple (Prototype / MVP)

Pick one story (e.g., Krishna & Kaliya) and focus on it fully.

Tools:

Unity or Unreal Engine for VR environment (both free versions available).

Blender / free 3D assets for characters, environments.

TTS (Text-to-Speech) or voiceover recordings for narration.

Start with pre-scripted narration, not full AI Q&A yet. The goal is to create presence and immersion, even in a small world.

🧩 Phase 2: Add Interactivity

Allow your son to move, explore, and interact with elements in the environment.

Simple interactions could include:

Walking to the river and seeing Kaliya emerge.

Clicking on Krishna to “hear an explanation” about his calmness.

Touching objects to hear moral or dharmic lessons.

🤖 Phase 3: Introduce AI Guidance

Use small AI models (even offline) to handle questions:

“Why did Krishna act this way?”

“Was Kaliya wrong?”

Start with limited domain knowledge — just enough to answer story-specific questions.

Over time, expand the AI knowledge base as more stories are added.

📚 Phase 4: Expand Library & Learning Themes

Add more stories gradually: Hanuman’s leap, Ganga avataran, Arjuna & Krishna dialogue, etc.

Introduce values-focused learning — courage, compassion, truth, dharma, etc.

Keep interactivity consistent so your son learns the “rules” of asking, exploring, and reflecting.

💡 Cost-Saving Tips

Use free 3D assets or low-cost marketplaces.

Consider open-source AI tools rather than proprietary APIs at first.

Start with tablet or PC VR (cheaper than full high-end VR headsets).

Record your own narration — adds a personal touch and saves cost.
